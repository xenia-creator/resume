    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p>Outside academics, I enjoy staying active through tennis and regular fitness training, which keeps me disciplined and goal-oriented. I also like exploring web development by building personal projects, experimenting with new tools, and learning modern design practices.</p>
<p>I have a strong interest in problem-solving beyond academics—whether it’s tackling logical riddles, chess strategies, or brain teasers that challenge creative thinking. Reading about space exploration and advancements in artificial intelligence also excites me, as it connects with my passion for technology and innovation.</p>
<p>On a more personal note, I find joy in spending time with dogs and caring for pets, which has taught me patience, responsibility, and empathy.</p>
